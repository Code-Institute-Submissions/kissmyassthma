##Â Testing website compatibility 
I used these four browsers to test the functionality of my website. I checked the nav, links and buttons, signup form and contact form. 
* [Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) - working correctly.
* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) - working correctly.
* [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) - working correctly.
## Testing website responsiveness
I used Chrome Developer Tools to test the responsiveness of my website on screens from a small mobile device to a computer screen. 
* I checked the responsiveness of my navbar, ensuring it turned to hamburger. 
* I checked the responsiveness of my google maps and markers, ensuring it sized correctly. 
* I checked the reponsiveness of my image carousel and image viewer, ensuring it sized correctly.
* I requested friends and family to open the site on their own screen of their choice and check functionality.
* I checked the responsiveness of my pop up modals, ensuring thei fit correctly on the screen.
#### Results
* Image viewer on blogs was not responsive and the script was not correctly loading. 
* Modal viewing was not responsive on screens smaller than a tablet, the scroll was not working and the close button was not visable. See image below...

#### Changes

### New Users

    * Index - Using the scroll on the mouse, they are able to easily navigate up and down the page to see content.
