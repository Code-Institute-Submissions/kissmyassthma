# Kiss my assthma
### "Because it's not just asthma..."
This website has been created to make people aware whilst educating them. Asthma is a condition that not many know about so the aim of this site was to build a community where it gives confidence. The site has a continued clean and flat design whilst being user friendly and interactive. Before creating the design and website a business strategy map was created. This allowed us to see the purpose, future, distribution and marketing channels along with competitors and competitive stategies; before finding a suitable design and website. Kiss my assthma was designed to have two S's as aposed to one. This comes with a light hearted pun which was thought to bring laughter to those who may be struggling with this condition.

# Deplopyment 
## GitHub Deplopyment
To allow my project to be viewed by others, I took the following steps
1. On GitHub, their internal navigation allowed me to go onto [settings](https://github.com/ameliabultitude/kissmyassthma/settings).
2. Once in the settings tab, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section.
3. On this section, you can select 'Master Branch' for the source.
4. This ensured others could see my pages on live updates.

## Google Maps Deplopyment
This allowed me to use an API. I merged it into my HTML for the map to be seen on my site.
1. Using ['Getting Started with Google Maps Platform'](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) I was able to set up an account.
2. After I created an account, I then was able to create an API Key and set the preferences and restrictions for it. 
3. This process can be copied for others to intregrate google maps into their html.
