Lots of people have something to say about it. Everybody should be wearing a mask, including those with Asthma. Yes it may feel a bit stuffy on your face, but with well ventilated masks, breathing will not be a problem. There are many articles which state asthmatics 'mild to severe' can wear a mask for short periods of time. Some people with asthma come and tell me that face coverings can make their breathing feel more difficult, which might be uncomfortable. It’s a good idea to try wearing a face covering at home, or on a short walk around the block first. It might not feel comfortable straight away, so give it a chance.
                            You can also experiment with different types of mask – some are easier to wear than others. Sometimes the feeling of wearing a face mask might take a bit of getting used to, but trying different types and starting with short periods of time can help you feel more comfortable. There isn’t a blanket rule about face covering exemptions for everyone with asthma. But if you find it impossible to wear a face covering for health reasons, you don’t have to wear one. An example of this might be if a mask makes you too breathless. But if you find wearing a mask too much, then you can download a exempt badge from Asthma UK website. For asthmatics it's hard to say which mask is the best as it is down to personal preference. Always try to wear a mask and find one that fits your face easily.">Read More

Xolair is used to treat allergic asthma, it is a pre-filled injection sringe. The dose changes per patient, it can range from one to four injections between two to four weeks.</p>

                            antibody. The overproduction of this protein may result in the development of various
                            allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hayfever), allergic asthma, venom sensitivity,food or drug allergy. There are many side effects of Xolair, and it is good to study these before accepting the drug. ">Read More

                                <p>Asthma and Eczema normally come hand in hand, so if you have asthma, chances are you may have a form of eczema at some point. Eczema is a completely manageable skin condition where there are small dry, lesions on the skin. Personally, I have eczema on my trunk, neck arms and legs, and I have used many different creams to help and offer moisturiser and a soother.</p>

                            1.	Aveeno Dermexa Emollient – I personally use this on my face. This is always my go to cream for when I am having a flare up on my face. I find it creamy, thick and soothing. It is sold in most high-street shops, online and in pharmacies. Dermexa offer a body wash, balm, hand-cream and a daily emollient. Aveeno is based on the use of finely milled colloidal oatmeal to manage dry skin conditions. Mayo Clinic Dermatologists recognised the work done by Aveeno Scientists and that is when Aveeno was born as a brand. Not only are these cream oat based, they are eco-friendly! 

                            2.	Zerobase – This is what I use on my trunk and limb. This is a prescribed cream which moisturises and protects dry skin. I find this a nice thick cream where a small bit goes a long way. This cream can be used in a shower to protect, a bath and for general use. Although I personally get along with Zerobase, it does contain 11% liquid paraffin which may cause irritation on other people’s skin. Any cream with paraffin or steroids in, discuss with a doctor before. As earlier stated, it is a prescribed cream which your doctor or dermatologist will discuss if necessary.

                            3.	E45 – E45 is another shop bought cream; high-street, online or pharmacies. This is a cream I tend to purchase if I cannot get hold of my Aveeno. E45 contains paraffin also, but it does not contain steroids. This offers a soothing, moisturiser to dry or irritated skin. This is a cream I can always rely on if needed. 
                            These are my top three creams that I use for my eczema. Please remember although these creams work well on my skin, it varies on each person so patch test creams always and read the ingredients. If there is something you are flaring up with, keep note and always look in a creams ingredients before you purchase!">Read More
